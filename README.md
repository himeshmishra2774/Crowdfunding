Crowdfunding Smart Contract on Aptos
ðŸ“Œ Description
This project is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the Aptos blockchain using the Move language.
It allows project creators to launch funding campaigns with a specified goal and lets supporters contribute Aptos tokens (AptosCoin).

The smart contract ensures transparency, security, and immutability of fundraising data, enabling trustless funding without intermediaries.

ðŸŽ¯ Vision
Our vision is to create a transparent, decentralized, and secure crowdfunding ecosystem where innovators, artists, and entrepreneurs can raise funds directly from supporters without relying on centralized platforms.

By leveraging Aptos blockchain technology, we aim to:

Reduce fraud in fundraising campaigns

Empower creators globally

Enable instant, borderless transactions

ðŸš€ Future Scope
Planned features for future versions of the contract:

Refund Mechanism â€“ Automatically return funds to contributors if the funding goal is not met by the deadline.

Multiple Projects Support â€“ Allow a single account to create and manage multiple projects.

Project Deadlines â€“ Add expiration dates for campaigns.

Contribution Tracking â€“ Maintain a list of contributors and their amounts.

NFT Rewards â€“ Issue NFTs as proof of contribution or special perks for backers.

Governance Features â€“ Let contributors vote on project decisions.
